            1.Introduction
          </h5>
          <p>
          <p>The rapid evolution of drug discovery is continuously fueled by cutting-edge technologies, 
          especially in understanding complex molecular interactions pivotal to medical therapies. Among the tools deployed, computational methods have garnered significant attention, 
          with <b>machine learning techniques</b> emerging as a key player in deciphering intricate patterns and optimizing solutions. 
          <b>Quantum computing</b>, when assisted by machine learning techniques, has the potential to redefine drug discovery. It not only presents an opportunity to solve challenges deemed impossible for classical computers but also enhances our ability to predict and understand molecular behaviors with unprecedented accuracy [1].</p>

          <br>

          <p>A critical molecule in the pharmacological landscape is the <b>hydroxyl radical (路OH)</b>. This radical is more than just a molecular entity; it's a central axis for numerous drug interactions. Its high reactivity is linked to oxidative stress, resulting in a range of health conditions, from neurodegenerative disorders and cardiovascular diseases to cancers. 
            Beyond its pathogenic roles, the hydroxyl radical is also integral to the efficacy of many drugs. With the development of quantum computing, we can potentially achieve a deeper understanding of the interactions and effects of molecules like the hydroxyl radical, accelerating breakthroughs in therapeutic developments.</p>
          </p>
          <p>
            Given its prominence, understanding the quantum mechanics of the hydroxyl radical  at an intricate level can significantly impact drug discovery processes. 
            A fundamental starting point is the accurate determination of its ground state energy. This knowledge can serve as a cornerstone, upon which more complex drug-radical interactions can be built. 
            However, the quantum realm is notoriously challenging. With the current limitations in qubit numbers and quantum error rates, comprehensive simulations of larger drug molecules remain a distant goal. This is where the elegance of the hydroxyl radical comes into play. 
            Its relatively smaller size offers a feasible task for current quantum computing capabilities, making it an ideal candidate for a quantum simulation challenge, and more importantly, paving the way towards the future research landscape that large scale is a fundamental need.

            2.Objective
          </h5>
          <p>
            The goal of the 2023 Challenge is to calculate the ground state energy of the hydroxyl radical (路OH).
          </p>
          <p>
            We ask participants to design and implement a working, open-source protocol that can automatically calcualte the ground state energy of the <b>hydroxyl radical (路OH)</b> from the give 
            hamiltonian. We allow the participants to freely explore the design space, with some guidlines below. Participants can propose good qubits mapping strategy by codesign by hardware and software;
            classical shadow can be potentially implemented to reduce the shots on observable to save the cost on quantum resources; AI/ML or scientific-based circuit architecture search framwork
            could give a good ansatz for better performance; AI/ML or scientific-based error mitigation can also helps for better performance; last but not least, the experience of optimizer, initial
            paramter or initial scaling of the parameter are important topic for this challenge.
          </p>
          <h5>
            3.Data
          </h5>
          <p>
            The data provided for this challenge revolves around the central theme of drug discovery, focusing on the fundamental quantum mechanics of the hydroxyl radical (路OH). 
            As a pivotal entity in numerous drug interactions and physiological processes, an intricate understanding of the hydroxyl radical is crucial. 
            To aid participants in this endeavor, we've curated a specialized dataset tailored to encapsulate the of the hydroxyl radical's hamiltonian.

			      We have provided the <a href="/"> the hamiltonian </a> for reference.
          </p>
		  <h5>
		    4.Data Format
		  </h5>
		  <p>
		    All data is formatted in text. The text file contains the Pauli strings and corresponding coefficiencies of the hydroxyl radical's hamiltonian by Jordan-Wigner mapping [2]. 
        Participants can generate different format of the description of the hydroxyl radical's hamiltonian by prefered tools, but we restricted the fermionic mapping method should be the Jordan-Wigner mapping [2],
        which should be 12 qubits and 631 pauli strings.

            5. IBM Qiskit Platform, System & Noise Model from Real Quantum Processor Backend
          </h5>
          <p>
            We acknowledge the use of IBM Quantum services for this contest. Qiskit [3] is an open-source quantum computing framework primarily developed by IBM. 
            It offers tools for creating and manipulating quantum programs and running them on prototype quantum devices and simulators. 
            Designed with modularity in mind, Qiskit provides components that cater to all aspects of quantum computing, from foundational elements to more advanced quantum algorithms.
            In the contemporary realm of quantum computing, noise poses a significant challenge [4].  
            As such, we urge all participants to consider the inherent noise when designing their quantum algorithms or circuits. 
            Qiskit [3] offers tools that facilitate the simulation of quantum algorithms or circuits as if executed on an actual quantum device, complete with the associated noise. 
            Simulating a quantum system, complemented with a noise model, is imperative to gain insights into the potential performance of quantum algorithms on current NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices [4]. 
            We acknowledge that while participants might be inclined to optimize basis gates at the pulse level to curtail the duration of the quantum circuit and thereby conserve quantum resources [5], 
            characterizing a time-dependent noise model from a real quantum machine poses unsolved obstacles in preparation for this quantum computing for drug discovery challenge. We regretfully must resort to using the standard gate-based noise model for evaluating circuits. 
            However, in the spirit of fairness, we will compute the relative decoherence fidelity and adjust your circuit performance accordingly [6].
          </p>
          <p>
            The IBM <a href="https://qiskit.org/"> qiskit platform </a> is open for public and easy to access online. However, if you do 
            need support, please contact us.
          </p>
		  <h5>
		    6.Scoring
		  </h5>
		  <p>
			  We will employ specific metrics to evaluate the submitted algorithms. The assessment encompasses the accuracy in estimating the ground state energy, 
        the consumption of quantum resources (number of shots and duration of the quantum circuit), and the demand on classical computational resources (number of iterations and number of parameters). Specifically, the precision of the ground state energy estimation accounts for maximum 100 credts, the consumption of quantum resources represents maximum 25 credits, 
        and the demand on classical computational resources contributes maximum 15 credits. And we require participants to self-reflect their techniques for maximum 10 points, which should include the tricks implemented in the preprocessing process, and to submit a short description of their used techniques. We will have three graders evaluate and do this extra 10 credits grading based on self-reflect score and other aspects including novelty, reasonability, and so on.
